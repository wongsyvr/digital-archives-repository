## Description

This photograph captures the early morning activities at Hong Kong's historic Central Market. Taken in 1955, it shows vendors arranging their produce and the first customers of the day arriving. The image provides valuable documentation of traditional market culture and architecture in post-war Hong Kong.

## Technical Details

The photograph was taken with a Rolleiflex 2.8F camera on Kodak Tri-X film. The print is a silver gelatin print made by John Smith in his personal darkroom. The image shows Smith's characteristic attention to composition and lighting, particularly in capturing the interplay of light through the market's architectural features.
