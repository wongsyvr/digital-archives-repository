This photograph captures a candid moment of a street vendor with his traditional wooden cart in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district. The vendor is shown arranging his display of local fruits, while pedestrians pass by in the background. The image provides valuable documentation of traditional street vending practices and daily life in 1950s Hong Kong.

## Technical Details
