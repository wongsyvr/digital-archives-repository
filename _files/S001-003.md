## Description

This photograph captures the vibrant nightlife of Temple Street Market in Hong Kong's Yau Ma Tei district. The image shows the market at its peak evening hours, with numerous stalls selling various goods, fortune tellers, street food vendors, and local residents and tourists browsing the offerings. The photograph is particularly notable for its capture of the neon signs and traditional paper lanterns that illuminate the scene.

## Technical Details

Photographed with a Leica M3 camera using a 35mm f/1.4 Summilux lens. The exposure was approximately 1/15 second at f/2, pushing Tri-X film to ASA 1200 to capture the ambient lighting while maintaining the atmosphere of the scene. The print shows Smith's expertise in night photography and his ability to balance artificial lighting sources.
