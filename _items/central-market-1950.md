Photograph showing the exterior of Central Market in Hong Kong,
taken from Queen's Road Central. The image captures the busy
morning activity with vendors setting up their stalls and early
morning shoppers. This photograph is particularly significant as
it shows the original façade of the market building before later
renovations.
